BBC News Reader does just that, it reads the BBC rss feeds and retrieves the associated articles and images and places them in a nice gui for browsing on Android based phones.

It is currently tested on Android versions:

* 2.3
* 4.0
* 4.2

However, it should work on any version > 2.2. Old versions of the app will support down to 1.6.

It supports all sizes of phone screens. There is a tablet view, but this has more limited functionality (at the moment).

## References
We use several other projects to help us:

* android-rss - a lightweight rss library - https://github.com/ahorn/android-rss
* ActionBarSherlock (v4.1.0) - ui compatibility for <4.0 devices - http://actionbarsherlock.com
* ViewPagerIndicator (v2.4.1) - page indicator in the category view - http://android.hlidskialf.com/blog/code/android-seekbar-preference
* drag-sort-listview (v0.4.1) - allows sorting of categories when choosing - https://github.com/bauerca/drag-sort-listview/
* Eula - displays the "eula" at first run -

We are very grateful for the hard work put into these projects which make things so much easier for us.
